# Troubleshooting

## Debugging pod

I've found that when troubleshooting pods in a kubernetes cluster it is sometimes useful to create an ubuntu pod or a python pod.

There is an easy way to do this, let's do a python pod by using this command `kubectl run python-debug --rm --tty -i --restart='Never' --image python:3.7-buster --command -- /bin/bash`:

```
$ kubectl run python-debug --rm --tty -i --restart='Never' --image python:3.7-buster --command -- /bin/bash
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
root@python-debug:/#  
```

Then you can run your commands:

```
root@python-debug:/#  python --version
Python 3.7.9
root@python-debug:/# 
```

And when your done just type `exit`.

```
root@python-debug:/# exit
exit
pod "python-debug" deleted
$ 
```

## curl trick

curl ouptut of k8s call as body, or you could use any output.  The magic is using the pipe `|` into a curl command and then using the `--data-binary @-`:

```
kubectl get pod <pod_name> -o json | curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data-binary @- http://127.0.0.1:3000/api 
```

## DNS

Visit official kubernetes site for additional [DNS troubleshooting](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-debugging-resolution/)

## Busybox

Create the busybox pod using the following command:

```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/randysimpson/tools/master/k8s/troubleshooting/busybox.yaml
```

If a specific namespace is desired use `--namespace=vmware-system-tmc`

From this pod you can query info about DNS or anything else a default pod would receive:

```
kubectl exec -ti busybox -- nslookup kubernetes.default
```

```
kubectl exec -ti busybox -n vmware-system-tmc -- cat /etc/resolv.conf
```
