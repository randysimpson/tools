# Troubleshooting

Visit official kubernetes site for additional [DNS troubleshooting](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-debugging-resolution/)

## Busybox

Create the busybox pod using the following command:

```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/randysimpson/tools/master/k8s/troubleshooting/busybox.yaml
```

If a specific namespace is desired use `--namespace=vmware-system-tmc`

From this pod you can query info about DNS or anything else a default pod would receive:

```
kubectl exec -ti busybox -- nslookup kubernetes.default
```

```
kubectl exec -ti busybox -n vmware-system-tmc -- cat /etc/resolv.conf
```
